# Awesome Starter Machine Learning [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome machine learning resources to help get started with Machine Learning. Inspired by other `awesome` pages and a struggle to find resources to get started with in one clear place.

## Other Awesome pages

- [`awesome-machine-learning`](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning) for resources on machine learning
- [`awesome-rnn`](https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-rnn) for resources on Recurrent Neural Networks
- [`awesome-artificial-intelligence`](https://github.com/owainlewis/awesome-artificial-intelligence) for literature on AI
- [`awesome-ode-neural-networks`](https://github.com/Zymrael/awesome-neural-ode) for literature relating to interplay between Oridinary Differential Equations and Neural Networks

# Useful resources

## MATLAB/Simulink

- [Simulink](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/neural-network-simulink-block-library.html): NN Block Library
  > It might be useful to build a model using Simulink to visualize the process, and have a look at the code generated to have a better grasp of how the logic in structured.
